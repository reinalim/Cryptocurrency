# Cryptocurrency

# Overview
This project is conducted for one of our clients who is in the Investment Banking indutry. The client is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The client requested to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. We has used the unsupervised learning method to group the cryptocurrencies - a clustering algorithm. weâ€™ll use data visualizations to share our findings with the board/client.

# Findings

## Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
1) Create an elbow curve to find the best value for K
2) Calculate the inertia for the range of K values
3) Create an Elbow Curve
